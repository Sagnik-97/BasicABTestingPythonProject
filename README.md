# 🧪 AB Testing on Marketing Campaign Performance

This project demonstrates the use of **A/B testing techniques** to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing strategy using real-world-like synthetic data. The goal is to determine whether a new version of a campaign (Group B) performs significantly better than the control (Group A) based on conversion rates.

### 🔍 Project Objective

To perform statistical A/B testing on two groups of users subjected to different marketing campaigns and evaluate whether the new strategy improves conversion rate.

This project showcases:
- Business problem framing
- Hypothesis formulation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical significance testing
- Result interpretation and business recommendations

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

1. Data Understanding  
   - Loaded and explored A/B testing data
   - Checked group distributions and campaign assignment

2. Data Cleaning  
   - Ensured proper formatting
   - Checked for nulls and consistency across groups

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Visualized distribution of conversions across control and treatment
   - Compared user behavior across segments

4. Hypothesis Testing*  
   - Set up null and alternative hypotheses
   - Applied **two-sample z-test** for proportions
   - Interpreted p-values and confidence intervals

5. Business Recommendations  
   - Based on the test results, provided clear recommendations on whether to proceed with the new campaign
